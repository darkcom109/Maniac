# Maniac

The Social Media Website for Being a Comedian. Gain Likes. Reach the Leaderboards.
This project was built using the Django framework.
All styling and design was done from scratch with help using the Bootstrap documentation
Improvements Required:
- Much better styling, the font is not appealing and was an attempt at a retro style. Google fonts did not have many options
