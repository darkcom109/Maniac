# Maniac

The Social Media Website for Being a Comedian. Gain Likes. Reach the Leaderboards.
This project was built using the Django framework.
All styling and design was done from scratch with help using the Bootstrap documentation

---
Friendly Note: This was my first time building a Django application and an attempt to build a retro-themed website,
the website styling may not look up-to-par as I did it all manually with Bootstrap v5
